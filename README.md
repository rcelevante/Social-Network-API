## CHALLENGES

I personally worked on the module's practice work and wiggled my way into this challenge. I used it as a template and followed what is needs to be done for this challenge. My only challenge would be the 404 error. For some reason, when it connects and I visit the api routes, it all shows a 404 error. I did ask a TA about it and basically commented out that 404 error and it seemed to work just fine. I did a 2 part video walkthrough and tried to include everything I need.
